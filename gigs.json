Unload right at the front door. Bandstand is at the extreme left of the lobby as you enter. Park your car in the gravel lot to the left as you exit the lobby. I believe that the last set will be short, but I also think it STARTS at 13:45 rather than ending at that time. We can just do 15 or 20 minutes for that last one if anyone had a prior commitment. \r\n\r\nNote that there are 75 minutes between sets while the church service is going on. There is a coffee shop in the lobby and a very nice patio just outside the lobby. Bringing a book or other diversion might be a good idea. There's a Starbucks and many other places one traffic light to the east on rt7. If you do leave the premises, please ensure that you are back on stage 5 minutes before each hit since the hit time is 100% firm. The other important detail is that there is no playing (no tuning, testing, etc.) in the lobby between sets. It may be a modern church, but it's still a church service. We can step right outside the door and warm up.\r\n\r\nA challenge will be to test the vocal mic before 9:00. Everything else should be cake for set up. \r\n\r\nOriginal background from Wayland:\r\n\r\n$100/person\r\nFormat:\r\nPlay a 30-min set after each of three services in the church's very large lobby (25 feet high ceiling, will hold hundreds of people).  The church has 2,000 people that attend these three services.  Downbeat/playing times would be, 1015-1045, 1200-1230, 1345-1415.  When a service ends (closing prayer or whatever) the ushers throw the auditorium doors open immediately...that's our cue to start...no delay.\r\n\r\nDress:\r\nblack on black.\r\n\r\n","u_private_notes":"","u_set_list_status":"In Progress","u_set_up_time":"1970-01-01 13:15:00","u_sound_check_time":"1970-01-01 05:00:00","u_sound_guy":"","u_start":"1970-01-01 15:15:00","u_start_time_string":"10:15am","u_startdt":"2014-08-31 14:15:00","u_total_income":"1900","u_type":"Gig","u_venue":"f7a5f61f6869cd00c87fa9d333bddf01"},{"__status":"success","sys_created_by":"gcox","sys_created_on":"2014-06-16 16:31:50","sys_id":"9c39621e3151ad00c87f0f29741e7074","sys_mod_count":"1","sys_updated_by":"gcox","sys_updated_on":"2014-06-16 16:32:51","u_band_name":"Swing Shift","u_calendar_name":"Swing Shift at Bethesda Metro Center on 2014-08-29","u_comments":"","u_contract_status":"","u_date":"2014-08-29","u_enddt":"2014-08-30 00:30:00","u_finish":"1970-01-02 01:30:00","u_initial_email_sent":"true","u_long_address":"1 Bethesda Metro Center - Bethesda - MD 20814","u_name":"Swing Shift at Bethesda Metro Center on 2014-08-29","u_notes":"Uniform: Hawaiian Shirt / Khakis / Sandals or Moccassins.\r\n","u_private_notes":"","u_set_list_status":"In Progress","u_set_up_time":"1970-01-01 20:30:00","u_sound_check_time":"1970-01-01 22:00:00","u_sound_guy":"","u_start":"1970-01-01 22:30:00","u_start_time_string":"5:30pm","u_startdt":"2014-08-29 21:30:00","u_total_income":"750","u_type":"Gig","u_venue":"fb849c390a0a3d380137da8501ce2bed"},{"__status":"success","sys_created_by":"gcox","sys_created_on":"2014-07-01 17:39:11","sys_id":"c988001331aded00c87f0f29741e7064","sys_mod_count":"2","sys_updated_by":"gcox","sys_updated_on":"2014-07-01 17:49:15","u_band_name":"Swing Shift","u_calendar_name":"Swing Shift at Church of the Good Shepherd on 2014-12-27","u_comments":"","u_contract_status":"Verbal%20Agreement","u_date":"2014-12-27","u_enddt":"2014-12-27 05:00:00","u_finish":"1970-01-01 05:00:00","u_initial_email_sent":"false","u_long_address":"9350 Braddock Road - Burke - VA 22015","u_name":"Swing Shift at Church of the Good Shepherd on 2014-12-27","u_notes":"Wedding gig.\r\nThree 45 minute sets\r\nBurke, VA","u_private_notes":"","u_set_list_status":"In Progress","u_set_up_time":"1970-01-01 05:00:00","u_sound_check_time":"1970-01-01 05:00:00","u_sound_guy":"","u_start":"1970-01-01 05:00:00","u_start_time_string":"0:00am","u_startdt":"2014-12-27 05:00:00","u_total_income":"3800","u_type":"Gig","u_venue":"2519801331aded00c87f0f29741e70fa"},{"__status":"success","sys_created_by":"mtrimboli","sys_created_on":"2014-05-30 20:25:57","sys_id":"e088b7bc31412d00c87f0f29741e7097","sys_mod_count":"3","sys_updated_by":"gcox","sys_updated_on":"2014-06-24 23:35:34","u_band_name":"Swing Shift","u_calendar_name":"Swing Shift at Columbus Club of Arlington (Arlington KofC) on 2014-11-01","u_comments":"","u_contract_status":"Contract%20Received","u_date":"2014-11-01","u_enddt":"2014-11-02 03:00:00","u_finish":"1970-01-02 04:00:00","u_initial_email_sent":"false","u_long_address":"5115 N Little Falls Rd - Arlington - VA 22207","u_name":"Swing Shift at Columbus Club of Arlington (Arlington KofC) on 2014-11-01","u_notes":"***LEAD ONLY***\r\n\r\nWedding\r\n\r\nMicah Meckstroth\r\n703-401-8799\r\nFormer AOL co-worker of Geoff and Matt.
